# Greedy Best-First Search and A* Pathfinding

This project implements two classic pathfinding algorithms — Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS) and A* — to navigate a grid or graph from a start to a goal node.

## Features
- Greedy Best-First Search implementation
- A* Search algorithm
- Visualization of pathfinding steps using matplotlib

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python "GBFS_A*.py"
   ```

## Dependencies

See `requirements.txt` for required libraries.
